        "For Windows, you can choose either the 32-bit or the 64-bit installer. Here’s the difference between the two:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### If your system has a 32-bit processor, then you should choose the 32-bit installer. If you attempt to install the 64-bit version on a 32-bit processor, then you’ll get an error at the beginning and the install will fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### On a 64-bit system, either installer will work for most purposes. The 32-bit version will generally use less memory, but the 64-bit version performs better for applications with intensive computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you’re unsure which version to pick, go with the 64-bit version.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have a 64-bit system and would like to switch from 64-bit Python to 32-bit (or vice versa), then you can just uninstall Python and then reinstall it by downloading the other installer from Python.org.\n",

        "2.  Run the Installer\n",

        "\n",
        "* The Install launcher for all users (recommended) checkbox is checked default. This means every user on the machine will have access to the py.exe launcher. You can uncheck this box to restrict Python to the current Windows user.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Add Python 3.8 to PATH checkbox is unchecked by default. There are several reasons that you might not want Python on PATH, so make sure you understand the implications before you check this box.\n",
