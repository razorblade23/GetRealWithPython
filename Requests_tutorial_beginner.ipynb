        "To understand Requests, we must first learn how HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) work and what does this protocol enable us to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms:\n",
        "HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). \n",
        "The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.\n",

        "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly what Requests library enables you to do. You ask server a question (in various forms as you will see soon) and server returns you answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP requests have a few methods for delivering data, depending on your need:\n",
        "GET \n",
        "The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.\n",
        "HEAD \n",
        "The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.\n",
        "POST \n",
        "The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.\n",
        "PUT \n",
        "The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.\n",
        "DELETE \n",
        "The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\n",
        "CONNECT \n",
        "The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.\n",
        "OPTIONS \n",
        "The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.\n",
        "TRACE \n",
        "The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.\n",
        "PATCH \n",
